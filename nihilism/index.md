Nihilism

> Note: This refers to one specific flavour of nihilism. If your understanding of nihilism is different and/or you disagree with anything here, that's a labelling problem, not anything to do with the philosophy iteself.

# Illustration

A cave, crowded full of people milling around, each carrying a huge backpack full of sand. They live their whole lives under these backpacks, and as they live, the backpacks are filled more and more. No-one ever acknowledges these backpacks, but life is a constant complaint about fatigue, bad backs and how difficult it is to move. However these people live full lives, runners run, jumpers jump, acrobats perform acrobatics. All with these packs that they carefully and subconsciously manipulate throughout their activities to avoid putting them down. It's done as thoughtlessly as someone scratching a really private itch in public, sometimes becoming aware that people are staring but unable to comprehend why.

Many people perform strength excercises and learn posture techniques that mean they can carry the packs with some ease.

One wall of the cave shimmers, terrifying voices come from this wall, beckoning. To step through this wall is certain death. Almost no-one thinks about or acknowledges the wall, and when their wanderings bring them near, they find some reason to turn around; they forgot something they need or it just occurred to them they need to exercise and take a longer route to their destination. The wall is almost never an explicit reason in their mind for anything.

On the other side of the wall, a few people stand on the grassland. They have put down their backpacks, they're free and can do all the things they wanted to do before, just with less encumbrance. From this side, the wall is transparent, and they can clearly see the people inside the cave. They call to them to put down their backpacks and step through the wall, even just for a second to see what it's like. But no one in the cave can bring themselves to do it. They barely acknowledge they have a backpack, and the words from the wall are terrifying to them. The people beyond the wall can't even reach anyone who's not already near the wall.

Life outside the wall is not special. However the act of putting down a backpack form the first time feels liberating in a way few other things can. Whilst the freedom compared to living with a backpack is incredible, it isn't perfection and doesn't mean the people following it are in any way perfect. It simply means that one aspect of life isn't made artificially difficult.

# Technicals

**Intellectual vs Experiential**: Experiential
There is almost no intellectual value to this philosophy. It cannot be used to determine what the best course of action is in any situtaion. The best that can be said is that it might allow for courses of action which are good, but which would be impossible outside the philosophy. The value for it comes purely from the act of applying the philosophy directly to your current situation, right now.
In other words, the value of the philosophy is in experiencign it. However, technical prose can't convey experience, only intellectual concepts, so it's not possible to convey the value in a paragraph like this. Poetry and illustrations like the one above can be used to illustrate experience, but again, can't be used to give the experience itself.

**Basic Tenets**:

* Nothing matters
* It is not possible to do nothing
* Everything has consequences
* Preferences exist


# Fears

When this is first presented, a number of immediate fears commonly come up. These specific fears are unjustified, and are the results of not being able to see the full picture. That doesn't mean there are not dangers to this philosophy, but only that the dangers are not direct and certain outcomes.

**Why do anything?**
When the phrase "nothing matters" gets uttered, it strikes fear into the hearts of many. We generally hold things mattering as a central core of our identity and this philosophy strikes a massive blow directly to that core. After all, we constantly re-inforce that the things we choose to matter to us are what define us.
Without things mattering, why would we do anything?
The simple answer is that it is not possible to do nothing. What we might informally consider "doing nothing" is very much itself an activity. If you want to lay on the floor and stare at the ceiling all day, you can, but that is an activity, it's a thing you're _doing_. Motivation is less of a problem when you realise you don't need motivation to do things. You can't avoid doing things. So if you're scared that you might stare at the walls all day, ask yourself what would actively motivate you to do that?

**Why do anything good?**
The next fear that pops up is that if nothing matters, we can do things that are evil, or lazy or otherwise "bad" by our current understanding. But saying that nothing matters is not at all the same as saying that nothing has consequences. If you act in a way that hurts someone and you're a functioning emotional human, you'll feel their pain through empathy. It's not normal for a healhty human to want to feel pain, even through empathy, so it would still be normal to avoid doing harm to others.
Equally, if we don't perform our roles in society, we lose access to basic food and shelter, or other options become limited. Again, it's difficult to justify why someone would actively want to acheive this, and if they did they could simply renounce them rather than follow destructive paths that result in it.
And humans react, and will always react to how they're treated. If you treat someone badly, you will get treated badly in return, get isolated.
So overall, the good things to do don't really change at all. Other philosophies may let you choose what good to follow.

**But why care if bad things happen to you?**
If you're in a restaurant, you have a menu of food to choose from. You can choose something you like, or something you don't like. Given complete freedom in the choices, why would you choose something you don't like?
The fact that it doesn't matter what you choose doesn't mean you're not able to. It doesn't mean you have any reason to choose the one you don't like.
It also doesn't mean your compelled to choose the same way a second time. If you thought you'd like option A but discover you don't, you can later freely choose option B, assuming you get the choice a second time.
If you like all options equally, then maybe you "don't mind" what you have. But the waiter can't bring you "don't mind". You can ask the waiter to choose for you, but that itself is a choice you make, the choice to "to let someone else choose". Like other choices, that might or might not be an option you like.
It's possible to choose to have nothing. But after a few rounds of choosing to have nothing you might discover you're not fond of the consequences of that choice and choose differently.
It isn't actually normal for us not to have a preference. And there are normally things we enjoy that don't have too many negative consequences. We can be free to choose these options with our eyes open and fill ourselves with them completely.

# Technique

Since this is an experiential philosophy, it's right to ask "so what do you *do* to experience it?"
I can only give my example of this, others might have their own approaches.

1. Examine something that's bothering you in your current situation. Some specific stress or bad feeling. Identify it and look at it in yourself. Maybe you didn't get a raise you wanted, just as an example. Or your worried about some future event.
2. Take multiple perspectives on the problem. Include outside perspectives. Consider this problem fully in the context of the whole world, all of history, and all the future.

    * Gradually work at it until you can see the whole thing without fear. Consider who's actually going to care about this in 100 years. Or 1000 years. Or a million. Or a billion. Actually think about it, the world where your problem exists and where it doesn't. What are the actual, ultimate consequences of what's going on?

    * What specific events from 100 years ago do you actually care about today? How many people didn't get the raise they wanted? How many people lost the love of someone close? How many people got put out onto the street? How many people died horrible, painful, protracted deaths?

    * Is the world different because of those events? Certainly, but is it actually better or worse? The real impact of someone dying in an accident 100 years ago? It's likely that in reality, the only effect to you is that the statistics for accidental deaths that year are `2049` rather than `2048`.

    * How many events have happened across the world in the last 100 years. How many are you even aware of, how many can you personally, even bring to mind right now. What's the probability that what you're experiencing would be one of those events?

    * Does it matter that Einstein discovered his general theory of relativity? World events might have played out very differently, but we'd still be arguing over politics, we'd still have wars and disagreements. Or maybe someone else would have discovered these things and the only difference would be the names associated with theories. They'd just be a little later arriving.

    * How many theories and ideas and actions could have happened in the past but didn't, and we don't know about them? I'd bet there's at least one person who would have had a ground breaking idea in the past that would have changed the world, but died before they were able to. Perhaps before they were even able to have the idea. Yet we still go on.

    * How strong a justification is it to say that something from the past matters because it has affected the future. We know that *everything* from the past has an effect on today. This is basic chaos theory. There isn't one thought you can think that won't imprint its changes indelibly on the history of the universe for every moment forward. It doesn't really make it better or worse, it just makes it different.

    * Do you really think you can control the future? There are billions of people in this world, all striving to do their best, some actively against you, some with you, but most are neutral. This is chaos personified. Do you really think that you're going to affect the world for good or for bad in this maelstrom? How many people do you know who can? What's the percentage of those who can to those who can't. Do you think they got there because they're more deserving than every other person around? Or did chance have a role to play? Can even these people predict the actual impact of their actions today, tomorrow or in a thousand years?

    * In the long enough timescales, everything and everyone you know is going to stop existing. How long can your mistake or failings be paid for? How long until at some point the later generations must take some sort of responsibility for their own situation? 100 generations from now are they still going to say "we're doing badly because Uncle Jim fucked up a bit 2000 years ago".

    * Thinking about the people and events you *do* know about from the past, do you actually know them? Jesus is a name that's echoed through the ages, but do you think you actually know anything about the real person? We can't even agree if he existed. What about Hitler? Is he really any more than a phantom? A ghost story? He had a profound impact in recent history yet how much do you actually care as you commute to work. How much will people care about a fuck up as big as hitler in 1000 years? If they do care, how much of that caring will be the story, the fantasy that was built over time vs what actually happened?

    * The chances are that the entirety of humanity, the entirety of life is going to die out at some point in the future. Does it matter if humanity survives for 10 million years or 11 million? How big an impact do you think your problem actually has in the world? Does it really matter that the end state of humanity is slightly different because you got a raise vs you didn't.

    * What are the actual consequences going to be for you? Maybe you're going to be homeless. So the impact is that the homeless number goes up by 1 this year. You're going to be unhappy, so the amount of unhappiness in the world, if we measure it in some amount of units, goes from "40 million to 40 million + 10".

    * When for a moment you stop thinking about these things from the inside and think about them in the whole, nothing much really changes. Nothing much is really happening. From the inside perspective it's terrifying, but it's nothing that really changes the world. Your pain is a matter of perspective.
    
    * Who else is going through this? The chances are thousands, millions of other people. Have some empathy, some sympathy for everyone else going through this, what makes you special? Have some solidarity for those nameless individuals struggling with you. You might never meet, but you know they're there.

    * This problem might change your entire life. But that's ok. People's lives change all the time, and then they change again, and again. Yes, scars occur, every action marks its landscape. Eventually, lives end. Yours is no different, it's what happens. You'll die rich or you'll die poor. You'll die old or you'll die young. You'll die happy or you'll die sad.

  3. These arguments are only suggestions, they're not exhaustive or even necessarily correct. Find your own, look at your situtation bravely and thoroughly and see it for what it really is.

  4. To have a goal in mind for these investigations defeats the point. Go through fully, logically and deeply wherever they turn. Follow the consequences as far as you can, and be ruthless. Ultimately, in my experience, they always end up in a certain place. I end up willing to suffer the physical or the emotional pain. And if I go far enough, not passively, but actively willing to go through it. At that point, suffering doesn't really seem an appropriate term anymore, it's just the situation. The suffering of the situtation gets burnt out. The more thoroughly you go through the investigation, the more thoroughly burnt out it gets.
 
  5. Find the next thing that's bothering you and repeat. It becomes like a dissection, pulling apart the layers that make up your issues. Neutralising each issue. Eventually, the phrase that comes to mind for me is "nothing actually matters", hence my approach here, but that's the end point, not the start. Other people come to different phrases, but they are from the same place. Other phrases could be "It's ok" or "Everything is meaningless".

  6. Over time, you'll get caught by other things that "matter", keep repeating the process.

Perhaps you can intellectually see where the illustration at the start comes from. The backpacks being our worries, the wall being this process of actually allowing us to see the full consequences and being ok with them, and the liberation of putting down all of those worries.

What's harder to see without going through some form of this process is how, when you look at other people with these burdens, it seems so unnecessary. People make so much of their own problems. And even those geniuses who've learned to heft their packs with skill and poise have learnt ... well, a pointless art. It's impressive, for sure, but it's not really necessary. "Yes, well done, it's impressive to do a backflip at the best of times, I'm impressed. With a backpack full of sand, really, I'm really impressed. But you don't need that backpack, you just made it more difficult for yourself".

Obviously, sometimes it's a thing to deliberately handicap yourself to make a feet even more impressive. There's value in that. But when someone is desperately trying to do a flip and failing and hurting themselves and getting frustrated and don't realise or acknowledge they're wearing a backpack, wouldn't you say "hey, you're wearing an entire backpack you don't need".
